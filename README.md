# STYLOMETRY IN R: AN INTRODUCTION

In this hands-on workshop we introduce Stylo, a literature analysis tool which may potentially be used for forensic linguistics, plagiarism detection or systematic means of literature review. Stylo is an open-source R programming environment which offers a rich, user-friendly suite of functionality well-suited for fast exploratory analysis of textual corpora as well as classification tasks such as are needed in authorship attribution.
